With the recent surge in their usage, particularly in the wake of the pandemic, ordering food through mobile apps has emerged as the go-to solution for countless individuals.</p>
        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">In this case study, I delve into the UX issues I encountered while using the widely popular Zomato food delivery app.</p>
        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">Imagine trying to order your favorite meal online, only to be confronted with a confusing and frustrating user experience. In this case study, I delve into the UX issues I encountered while using the Zomato food delivery app, highlighting the challenges faced by users and the solutions I proposed to enhance their overall experience.</p>
       
        <div class="breif_container"><b style="font-size: 30px; color: #292929;" >Overview</b></div>
        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">One of the main UX issues I encountered while using the Zomato food delivery app revolved around navigation and ease of movement within the app. After conducting multiple searches for specific restaurants or food items, I found myself facing a significant challenge when I wanted to change my selection or explore other options.
        <p class="research breif_container"style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">The app lacked intuitive navigation options, making it difficult to go back or move to different sections within the app seamlessly.</p>
        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">While there was a back button for searching results, there were no clear options to navigate back or navigate to other areas within the app, leading to a frustrating user experience.</p>

        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">As part of my research to understand the user experience of the Zomato app, I have conducted user interviews to gather valuable insights and identify pain points. their feedback and experiences are crucial in helping me to improve the search function and navigation within the app.</p>
        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">There are some colleagues of mine who frequently use the Zomato app to order food. So, I asked some questions to them.</p>
