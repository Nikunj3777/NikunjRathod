With the recent surge in their usage, particularly in the wake of the pandemic, ordering food through mobile apps has emerged as the go-to solution for countless individuals.</p>
        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">In this case study, I delve into the UX issues I encountered while using the widely popular Zomato food delivery app.</p>
        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">Imagine trying to order your favorite meal online, only to be confronted with a confusing and frustrating user experience. In this case study, I delve into the UX issues I encountered while using the Zomato food delivery app, highlighting the challenges faced by users and the solutions I proposed to enhance their overall experience.</p>
       
        <div class="breif_container"><b style="font-size: 30px; color: #292929;" >Overview</b></div>
        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">One of the main UX issues I encountered while using the Zomato food delivery app revolved around navigation and ease of movement within the app. After conducting multiple searches for specific restaurants or food items, I found myself facing a significant challenge when I wanted to change my selection or explore other options.
        <p class="research breif_container"style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">The app lacked intuitive navigation options, making it difficult to go back or move to different sections within the app seamlessly.</p>
        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">While there was a back button for searching results, there were no clear options to navigate back or navigate to other areas within the app, leading to a frustrating user experience.</p>

        <p class="research breif_container" style="letter-spacing: 0.04em;">There are some colleagues of mine who frequently use the Zomato app to order food. So, I asked some questions to them.</p>
